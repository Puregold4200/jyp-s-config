This is my personal config. It's designed for me, so it may not work for you.

## This config includes:
-  My Graphic Config, which makes TF2 look very ugly but increases FPS greatly.
-  My Binds File, which includes most of my TF2 Binds.
-  My "Network" File, which is my settings involving connection to TF2.
-  My "Custom" File, which includes edits towards the config and other stuff that I personally added.
	
This is a heavily modified Masterconfig mixed in with cfg.tf's Crosshair Switcher.

## Other things I use

- No Hat Mod Bgum https://gamebanana.com/mods/205768 (Options: No Hats BGUM, No Hats Creators tf, No Unusuals, No Bugged Misc)
