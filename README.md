This is my personal config. It's designed for me, so it may not work for you.

## This config includes:
-  My Graphic Config, which makes TF2 look very ugly but increases FPS greatly.
-  My Binds File, which includes most of my TF2 Binds.
-  My "Network" File, which is my settings involving connection to TF2.
-  My "Custom" File, which includes edits towards the config and other stuff that I personally added.

- My HUD (Modified ZONAhud) with custom crosshairs.
- Soundscapes for disabled footsteps and disabled background noise on TF2 Maps.
- Flat Textures
- No Hats
	
This is a heavily modified Masterconfig, mixed in with cfg.tf's Crosshair Switcher, JarateKing's CleanTF2Plus and No-Hats-Mod-bgum.

## Most notable game settings changed:
- The Graphics of the game are set to incredibly low, most textures coming up as "flat"
- Viewmodel Fov is set to **90**
- Quickswitch and autoreload are enabled
- Medic radar is enabled and set to **59%** of patient health
- Medic autoheal (healing without holding the button) is enabled
- Hitsounds enabled, have different pitches for high and low damage
- Killsounds enabled, pitches are the same by default
